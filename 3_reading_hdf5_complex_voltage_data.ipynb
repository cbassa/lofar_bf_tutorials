    "3. Next, we will Fourier transform the complex timeseries. Assuming it is called `cin`, use `cout = np.fft.fftshift(np.fft.fft(cin.reshape(nint, nchan, -1), axis=1), axes=1)` to perform the transform. This single command performs multiple steps: `cin.reshape(nint, nchan, -1)` reshapes the 2D array to a 3D array with shape $n_\\mathrm{int}\\times n_\\mathrm{chan}\\times n_\\mathrm{sub}$, next `np.fft.fft(..., axis=1)` performs the 1D Fourier transform along axis 1, which is $n_\\mathrm{chan}$. The resulting output has the two halves of the spectrum swapped, and `np.fft.fftshift..., axes=1)`, swaps the two halves back into the correct frequency order along the $n_\\mathrm{chan}$ axis. What is the shape and type of the output values of `cout`?\n",
    "4. `numpy` has a handy function to compute the frequencies of channels of a Fourier transform. Run `np.fft.fftfreq?` to see the usage of this function. Use this function, together with `np.fft.fftshift` to compute an array of the frequency values around the center frequency of each subband.\n",
